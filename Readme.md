# How to implement DXSerializer support for custom and standard controls 
Â 
We use the **DXSerializer** class to save/restore the layout in most of our WPF controls - see [Saving and Restoring Layouts](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/7391/common-concepts/saving-and-restoring-layouts) for more information. This example demonstrates how to use the same class for your custom controls or even standard components.

To enable **DXSerializer** for a particular control, set the attached **DXSerializer.SerializationID** property for it.

The next step is to specify what properties should be saved and restored. For this, you can use either of the following approaches.
- Assign the **XtraSerializableProperty** attribute to the required property. Here is one more example where we used this approach - [How to serialize custom panels and their properties](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-serialize-custom-panels-and-their-properties-e2324). 
- Subscribe to **DXSerializer.CustomGetSerializablePropertiesEvent**. In this example, we did this using the built-in **DXSerializer.AddCustomGetSerializablePropertiesHandler** method.
